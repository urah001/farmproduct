since i got the data an external file while might also be equavalent to serve or admin page why not use the same idea in your code :
- create new entry and add this as :
{
    id: 1,[unique-int]
    new: false,[boolean]
    featured: true,[boolean]
    name: "John Doe",[name]
    price: 2000.99,[float]
    image: "/baut.svg?height=600&width=600",[based]
    category: "Beauty", [word] [predefined-path-category]
    slug: "john-doe", [word] [predefined-path-goods]
    description: "Reliable and trustable worker", [word]
    features: ["Reliable", "Patient"], [multiple]
  },
  
  - get the data from strapi 
  - test to see if the req data is the right one 
  - may the universe be with u
